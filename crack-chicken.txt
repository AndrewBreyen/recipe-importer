Creamy Crack Chicken Enchiladas 

1 lb shredded rotisserie chicken
10 strips of bacon, cooked and chopped
3/4 cup colby jack cheese
1/8 cup ranch seasoning powder
1 block of cream cheese, softened
1 dollop of sour cream
8 flour tortillas
1 cup red enchilada sauce
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream

Preheat the oven to 350ºF.


In a large bowl, combine the shredded rotisserie chicken, cooked and chopped bacon, Colby jack cheese, ranch seasoning powder, softened cream cheese, and a dollop of sour cream. Mix the ingredients until well combined.

To make the tortillas more pliable, microwave them for about 1 minute. Alternatively, you can heat them briefly in a dry skillet.

Place a portion of the filling mixture in each tortilla and roll them up burrito-style. Arrange the rolled enchiladas in a 9x13-inch baking dish.

In a separate bowl, mix together the red enchilada sauce and the heavy whipping cream. Pour this sauce mixture over the top of the enchiladas.

Sprinkle additional Colby jack cheese on top of the enchiladas.

Bake the enchiladas in a preheated oven at 350°F for 25-35 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F, and the top is crispy.

Once done, you can garnish the enchiladas with chopped fresh herbs like cilantro or green onions before serving.
